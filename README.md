## Task

- I have been tasked with calculating the total number of months in the dataset.
- I have been tasked with calculating the net total amount of Profit and Loses over the entire period.
- I have been tasked with calculating the average of the changes in Profit and Loses over the entire period. (Track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average). So total - number of months - 1
- I have been tasked with calculating the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- I have been tasked with calculating the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
